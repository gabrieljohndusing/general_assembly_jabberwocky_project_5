      "REYKJAVIK, Iceland  A 5.6-magnitude earthquake hit southwest Iceland on Tuesday, shaking buildings in the capital, Reykjavik. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\r\n",
      "The Icelandic Meteorological Office said the quake struck at 1:43 p.m. (1343GMT) and was centered near Krysuvik, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) south of Reykjavik.\r\n",
      "Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir was speaking at a live Zoom event hosted by the Washington Post when she paused mid-sentence at the time the quake struck. Oh my god, there is an earthquake, she said.\r\n",
      "She added: Well, this is Iceland.\r\n",
      "The Icelandic Met Office has warned residents in western Iceland more quakes could follow. Scientists have not noted increased volcanic activity in the region, as is often the case with seismic activity in Iceland.\r\n",

      "NEW DELHI, Oct 22:\r\n",
      "The entire Himalayan arc is poised to produce a sequence of great earthquakes, and the next big quake  of the magnitude of 8 or above  may occur during our lifetimes, according to a study reviewing geological, historical, and geophysical data.\r\n",
      "The human toll of such an event in the densely populated countries across the arc is likely to be unprecedented, the researchers said.\r\n",
      "The study notes that the sequence of future Himalayan earthquakes could be similar to the great earthquakes that occurred in the twentieth century along the Aleutian subduction zone, which extends from the Gulf of Alaska to Kamchatka in Russian Far East.\r\n",
      "The review, which appeared in the journal Seismological Research Letters in August, used basic geological principles stratigraphic analysis, structural analysis, soils analysis, and radiocarbon analysis  to estimate the size and timing of prehistoric earthquakes and evaluate future risk.\r\n",
      "The entire Himalayan arc extending from the eastern boundary of Arunachal Pradesh (India) in the east to Pakistan (in the west) has in the past been the source of great earthquakes, study author Steven G. Wesnousky said.\r\n",
      "These earthquakes will occur again and scientifically, it would not be a surprise if the next great earthquake occurred in our lifetimes. But the resolution of our studies is at best on the order of 100 years, longer than a human lifetime, said Wesnousky, a professor of geology and seismology and director of the Center for Neotectonic Studies at the University of Nevada at Reno, US.\r\n",
      "Seismologist Supriyo Mitra noted that the research matches previous studies.\r\n",

      "Seismic waves and sound waves aren't so different. One moves through rock and fluid, the other through air.
