      "Hawaii is marking the first anniversary of one of the largest and most destructive volcanic eruptions in its history. Lava flowed from the Kilauea Volcano for months, wiping out more than 700 homes on the Big Island. The eruption produced enough lava to cover a two-lane highway stretching from Boston to Seattle – and it would be more than 70 feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The molten rock that consumed much of Leilani Estates covers almost 14 square miles and at some points it is 100 feet thick. The lava has long hardened but, as CBS News' Carter Evans learned, the disaster has also hardened the resolve of the people living there.\n",
      "\n",
      "For four months, the eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano offered a spectacular combination of beauty and destruction. The most hard-hit neighborhood was Leilani Estates, where resident Stacy Welch watched lava from fissure 8 pour onto her property. At one point it fountained lava about 250 feet in the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fissure 8 was one of the most active of 24 lava-filled cracks in the ground. That's where Evans spoke to Heath Dalton last year, whose home was also destroyed. Dalton is unsure what he'll do with his land.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have an ocean view now, so that's a plus,\" Dalton said. \"It is what it is. You can't dwell on it. I mean it's been a year, you've got to move on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But \"moving on\" has been a challenge. A year later, huge portions of once-green land remain a sea of black. When you look down from the sky on Leilani Estates, it's eerie. You can still see steam vents along the rift zone even coming up between homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some 3,000 people were impacted and officials are still trying to determine how many will rebuild. Many major roads remain closed despite complaints from residents. From the air, you can see the plea to open Highway 132. Along the coast, tide pools are now filled with solid rock, part of the nearly 900-acres of new land formed as lava hit the ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rivers of molten rock left canyon-sized scars on the land and while Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has re-opened, geologists say Kilauea is still a very active volcano. Janet Babb of the U.S. Geological Service said we'll \"definitely\" see lava again. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      " \"Our best estimate is that lava could return to the summit in a matter of months to years, and then could return to one of the rift zones in a matter of years to decades,\" Babb said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stacy Welch's home was spared this time, but she knows the danger is ever-present.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's tense. It's beautiful. It's sad,\" she said of what it's like to live under that threat. \"Everyone behind me is gone … it's really in your heart that you are so lucky, when you realize, everything, every memory, every blade of grass that they had is gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tourism is the biggest industry in Hawaii and that's been hard-hit by Kilauea as well. Both the number of visitors and visitor spending have seen double-digit declines in the past year.\n",
      "==============\n",
      "\n",
      "LEILANI ESTATES, Hawaii — A year after a volcano on Hawaii's Big Island rained lava and gases in one of its largest and most destructive eruptions in recorded history, people who lost their homes and farms in the disaster are still struggling to return to their cherished island lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 700 homes were destroyed in the historic eruption, and most people will never move back to their land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of four months, Kilauea spewed enough lava to fill 320,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, burying an area more than half the size of Manhattan in up to 80 feet (24 meters) of now-hardened molten rock. The lava reduced landmarks, streets and neighborhoods to a vast field of blackened boulders and volcanic shard.\n",
      "\n",

      "Among those whose lives were forever changed are Tisha Montoya and her family, who lived off the grid on several acres downslope from where the eruption began.\n",
      "\n",
      "They had a large house and several cabins, along with greenhouses, pavilions and animal pastures. Montoya harvested different types of exotic fruit and had a pineapple garden, sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits and Guinea pigs.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 4, the day after the eruption started, she evacuated when a 6.9-magnitude earthquake violently jolted the family's purple octagonal home. Lava was pouring from new cracks in the nearby Leilani Estates neighborhood, and toxic gases filled the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father, Edwin Montoya, stayed behind to care for the animals. He hoped the entire family would soon be able to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edwin's children begged him to leave as the lava crept toward their property over the coming weeks. But he was committed to saving the animals, and he was prepared to die doing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If it blows its top and I'm there at the time, I'm 76 years old, I've lived a good life, and if I have to go, I want to go,\" Edwin Montoya told The Associated Press last May. \"I love Hawaii, and this is where I want to stay for the rest of my days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the lava neared, Edwin's focus turned from taking care of the animals to evacuating them. He left the day before a river of lava arrived and cut the farm in half. The molten rock eventually took nearly all the structures, including the home and all but one small chicken coop that Edwin built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lava stopped flowing the first week of September. Edwin died less than a week later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was very stressful to evacuate 100 animals out of here,\" Tisha told the AP of her father's death.\n",
      "\n",
      "He woke her up one night because he was having trouble breathing. \"We didn't make it to the hospital,\" she said. \"He passed and then they said later it was a heart attack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All roads to the family's farm are cut off, leaving it accessible only by a two-hour hike through thick jungle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This was the most special spot on the whole land,\" she said as she paused to pray near the miles-long wall of lava covering her home. \"So we buried him here as he wanted us to. His ashes, anyway, are sprinkled right over there on the edge, where the lava meets the green.\"\n",

      "Mark and Jennifer Bishop's house sat atop a ridge in Leilani Estates, their deck looking out toward friends' homes in a valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "The epicenter of the 2018 eruption — one of more than 20 places where the ground split open and released massive explosions of molten rock — is now in their front yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The eruption point, known as Fissure 8, created a towering cone that pumped out so much lava that it filled the valley in front of their property and flowed about 8 miles (13 kilometers) to the ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We used to be on the ridge. Now we're halfway down the hill,\" Mark Bishop said last week, looking up at the massive cone.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, lava hitting the ocean created nearly 1 square mile (2.6 square kilometers) of new land, including a new black sand beach.\n",

      "The Bishops split their time between the Big Island and Harmony, Minnesota, where they own a business that gives tours of scenic cave.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were in Minnesota when the eruption began, so they watched news reports and aerial video as lava blasted from the ground near their home. A friend called one day to tell them the lava was headed directly toward their house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The red-hot fluid oozed onto their property and stopped about 20 feet (6 meters) from the home. Theirs is now the last house on the street.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We just feel really fortunate that our home wasn't taken,\" Mark Bishop said. \"All of our neighbors to the north of us are all gone for like a mile-and-a-half wide.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Debris from the nearby eruption infiltrated the Bishops' home and caused extensive damage, but the couple has begun to replace furniture and appliances and recently moved back in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our plans are to stay here, keep working on the home and do the repairs as necessary, and just try to get back on to a normal life again,\" Mark Bishop said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark Figley bought his four-bedroom Leilani Estates home in 2016. A retired engineer who moved to Hawaii from Alaska, he envisioned spending his golden years working in his woodshop and fixing up old cars.\n",

      "Now, he said, the large craftsman-style home with vaulted ceilings and meticulously designed details is a complete loss — even though it was spared when the lava stopped in the front yard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gases and debris from a string of eruptions across the street did extensive damage to his home. But that's not the reason he had to buy a new house while continuing to pay the $500,000 mortgage on his now-empty dream home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The main reason I can't live here is because of air quality,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prevailing winds bring the volcanic gases toward his Leilani Estates house, which sits in a small valley where the fumes accumulate and build up in his home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If I'm in there for 15 minutes, I will have a bad headache,\" Figley said. \"It's not a livable circumstance for me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for now, the home on the edge of a lava flow remains vacant as Figley settles into his new Big Island home, a little farther from Kilauea volcano.\n",

      "Two weeks after the cyclone struck Odisha state on India's east coast, travelling at 200 km (124 miles) an hour and forcing the evacuation of more than one million people, Hussein is struggling to pick up the pieces and rebuild his home.\n",

      "As well as having no electricity, not enough clean drinking water and no tree cover, thousands like Hussein are now exposed to heatwave conditions with temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius.\n",

      "\"I don't know that understanding this system would've changed the outcome on this. In a million miles, you're going to maybe fly this airplane, maybe once you're going to see this, ever. So we try not to overload the crews with information that's unnecessary so they actually know the information we believe is important,\" he said, according to the recording obtained by CBS. \n",
      "But he also said that he did not \"disagree\" that pilots deserved to know what was on the plane.\n",

      "\"It's not a separate system to be trained on,\" he said.\n",
      "Boeing declined to comment to The New York Times specifically on the November meeting, but provided a statement saying: \"We are focused on working with pilots, airlines and global regulators to certify the updates on the Max and provide additional training and education to safely return the planes to flight.\"\n",
      "The company is currently working on a software fix that, when approved by the FAA and regulators around the world, will likely see the plane return to service.\n",
      "But Michaelis urged Boeing to take action to fix the plane at the November meeting. He said that Boeing should get the Federal Aviation Administration to instruct Boeing and airlines to update the software, which would have likely resulted in the plane being grounded temporarily, The New York Times reported.\n",
      "Sinnett said Boeing \"don't want to rush and do a crappy job of fixing the right things and we also don't want to fix the wrong things\" and said that Boeing was examining the plane to see if there were any problems with its design.\n",

      "Boeing lost $1 billion in profit in the first quarter of the year, and has slowed production of the Max jets. It received no new orders for the aircraft since they were grounded around the world, and received no new orders for any of its aircraft models in April.\n",
      "Boeing faces lawsuits from victims' families and shareholders, as well as federal investigations into how the plane was certified to fly by the FAA.\n",
      "Muilenburg said that Boeing will \"earn and re-earn\" flyers' trust and pledged that the plane will be one of the safest-ever when it returns to service, but at the same time defended the design of the plane.\n",

      "© ASSOCIATED PRESS A statue of explorers Lewis and Clark is surrounded by floodwater along the St. Louis riverfront, Thursday, May 2, 3019. Several Mississippi River towns are seeing floods that are closing in on the historic levels reached in 1993. (AP Photo/Jim Salter) When Tchula lake overran its banks, after heavy rains, Walter Coats’s home was one of the first to succumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I left that morning when I saw the waters start rising,” Coats said. “When I came back I couldn’t even get in the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Related: Poorest town in poorest state: segregation is gone but so are the jobs\n",
      "\n",
      "That was in late February. It’s been more than 70 days since but Coats said he has not received even a promise of help. Right now he’s staying down the road in an abandoned home, without power or running water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain’t got shit in there!” he said, in a gruff burst of frustration. “I gotta get a five-gallon bucket of water, fill it up and take it in if I want to take a bath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He gestured at the soggy contents of his dresser, strewn about the damp floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not the only one. Dozens more in Tchula, a small, 99% black town in central Mississippi, described struggles with slowly receding floodwaters and a lack of official help. They also described a more insidious devastation, produced by economic stagnation that preceded the storm clouds by decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the US Census, the town is the poorest in Holmes county, which is the poorest county in the state of Mississippi, which is the poorest state in the union. For many in Tchula, the flooding has been the last straw.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Time to speak up, time to make noise,” said Harriet Carter, out front of her still-flooded home, its windows wrapped in plastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a gloomy Thursday, with more rain forecast, she stood with her daughter and granddaughter in prayer with the civil rights leader the Rev Dr William Barber, who had come to see the conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can lift what’s happening here to the light that the darkness might go away,” Barber said, to amens. “Lift it until the people in power must pay attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Flooding is not new in the Mississippi basin, into which Tchula lake drains. But this spring brought historic devastation to homes and agriculture throughout the plains states, causing billions of dollars in losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of economic assessment is usually the prelude to the distribution of disaster aid and insurance payouts and the staging of emergency sessions by lawmakers seeking to appropriate funds for relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of that happened in Tchula, a town of about 2,000 with three stores and one restaurant on its blink-and-you’ll-miss-it main drag.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s one thing to face a hurricane or a flood where you go through it,” Barber, co-chair of the grassroots Poor People’s Campaign, told the Guardian. “It’s damaging, devastating, and then there’s a determination by all of the people who can do something to rebuild and come out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it’s almost as though these people have to face what I call ‘DOTSD’, where instead of post-traumatic stress disorder, it’s daily ongoing traumatic stress disorder. It just keeps continuing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marilynn Grier, Barber’s words described life pretty well. Like Coats, she lives in a trailer home just off the lake that she left when the flood came on.\n",
      "\n",
      "She described a childhood of relentless instability: an alcoholic mother, daily uncertainty about where her next meal would come from or where she might sleep, moves back and forth between Tchula and Milwaukee.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her teens, she was sexually assaulted. By 14, she had her first child. By 16, she had dropped out of school, to take care of her children and those of other family members. She has never been employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s hard,” she said, “when you ain’t got an education to get a job.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now 35, she is still working towards a GED, the equivalent of a high-school education. But she said the $35 monthly fee was an impediment to completing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the floods, she said, Tchula was a place where she worried about her children’s safety and schooling. She recalled nights spent on the floor, seeking a modicum of protection from shootings throughout the neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grier wants to see Tchula change, though she isn’t sure how. She has enough hope that, mid-conversation, she takes out her phone and blasts out a Facebook post, asking neighbors if they are willing to get together and clean up trash.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I encourage all my children to get the hell out of Mississippi, period,” she said. “I tell them, ‘If y’all want to be somebody and have something, you got to get away.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The last time Tchula was inundated, help came. It was the early 1980s and the town was still somewhat integrated. As Tchula became more black, though, fewer resources seemed to be available.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The white people are not here anymore,” said Marie Nelson, a lifelong resident, “because back when black people started being able to afford homes, if you moved next door to a white person, they sold their home just not to be next door to the black people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the town sits in a state of slow decay: dotted with ramshackle trailers, stray dogs roaming, paint stripping off boarded-up homes in the pervasive humidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nelson worked most of her career at a fish plant in Belzoni, the next town over. She started in the late 1980s, making the federal minimum wage of $3.35 an hour. She sees herself as one of the lucky ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no jobs to go to and get,” she said. “They got to bring work for people to go get work and right now there is no work to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Holmes county the unemployment rate is 9.4%, nearly three times the national average.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we talk about record low unemployment in this country right now, that’s not being reflected here in Tchula,” said Barber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber’s Poor People’s Campaign is a political and social movement built on the idea that political discourse in the US almost always centers around tension between the middle class and the rich but rarely mentions the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber calls this lack of attention a form of violence, a framing he credits to the late Coretta Scott King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ‘attention violence’ that we have given to the poor is, in my estimation, the greatest failure of the country and our political system,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most recent flooding, 20 Mississippi counties were designated disaster zones. Holmes wasn’t one of them. According to official state numbers, only two homes in the county were damaged, an undercount made obvious by even a cursory glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials from the Mississippi emergency management administration (Mema) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing that number for the first time, the 51-year-old lifelong Tchula resident Gerry Watts could not help but walk off laughing.\n",
      "\n",

      "BHUBANESWAR: As the Smart City struggles to get back on its feet after Cyclone Fani , the big parks, which bore the brunt of its fury, have again started seeing walkers and joggers early in the morning.The parks that underwent speedy renovation are Biju Patnaik Park, Indira Gandhi Park, Buddha Jayanti Park, Mahatma Gandhi Park , Kelucharan Mohapatra Park, Kharavel Park, Madhusudan Das Park, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Park and Kalinga Nagar Park and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Park.The 10 big parks managed by the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA), spread over an area of five acres, add to the city's green canopy. Most of the big trees in the parks were uprooted, generating massive green waste.The BDA had to use 10 excavators and around 200 labourers to clean the waste. The authorities have so far restored the open air gyms and repaired the children's play equipment inside the parks so that citizens can spend time there.\"We removed around 1,000 tonnes of green garbage from the 10 parks. The smaller and community parks are still under renovation,\" an officer of the BDA said.\"The damage was so severe that 80 people had to be engaged to clean the parks. They had to undertake 200 trips with tractors full of green waste from Biju Patnaik Park alone. We have made the parks operational though there is still some waste near the island portion of the parks,\" the officer added.There are more than 120 parks in the city. While the BDA has 57 parks under its management, 63 parks are handled by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC).Nagendra Bihari Panda, a dental surgeon, said, \"We are happy that the neighbourhood parks have been readied for walking and relaxing purposes in this time of power outages and high humidity. Though there are fewer trees now, the parks, lawns and gym equipment are ready.\"The green waste generated from the parks was transported to the Temporary Transit Station (TTS) near Sainik School from where it was taken to the dump yard at Bhuasuni. Removal of the green waste has been going on round the clock.Ajit Dash, a social activist, said, \"The parks in Bhubaneswar give a unique identity to the city but damage to them has been extensive. After the restoration work is over, the forest department along with the communities and other agencies should take steps to plant saplings,\" he added.\n",

      "When Tchula lake overran its banks, after heavy rains, Walter Coats’s home was one of the first to succumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I left that morning when I saw the waters start rising,” Coats said. “When I came back I couldn’t even get in the house.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The water was high. His weathered wooden steps had washed clear away.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was in late February. It’s been more than 70 days since but Coats said he has not received even a promise of help. Right now he’s staying down the road in an abandoned home, without power or running water.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ain’t got shit in there!” he said, in a gruff burst of frustration. “I gotta get a five-gallon bucket of water, fill it up and take it in if I want to take a bath.”\n",
      "\n",
      "What few things his modest trailer housed are gone, taken by looters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They picked my stove and they wasted all my clothes – you see that!?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He gestured at the soggy contents of his dresser, strewn about the damp floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Staring into his home, its door torn ajar, his voice swelled with emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was not the only one. Dozens more in Tchula, a small, 99% black town in central Mississippi, described struggles with slowly receding floodwaters and a lack of official help. They also described a more insidious devastation, produced by economic stagnation that preceded the storm clouds by decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the US Census, the town is the poorest in Holmes county, which is the poorest county in the state of Mississippi, which is the poorest state in the union. For many in Tchula, the flooding has been the last straw.\n",

      "“Time to speak up, time to make noise,” said Harriet Carter, out front of her still-flooded home, its windows wrapped in plastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a gloomy Thursday, with more rain forecast, she stood with her daughter and granddaughter in prayer with the civil rights leader the Rev Dr William Barber, who had come to see the conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We can lift what’s happening here to the light that the darkness might go away,” Barber said, to amens. “Lift it until the people in power must pay attention.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Flooding is not new in the Mississippi basin, into which Tchula lake drains. But this spring brought historic devastation to homes and agriculture throughout the plains states, causing billions of dollars in losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "That kind of economic assessment is usually the prelude to the distribution of disaster aid and insurance payouts and the staging of emergency sessions by lawmakers seeking to appropriate funds for relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "None of that happened in Tchula, a town of about 2,000 with three stores and one restaurant on its blink-and-you’ll-miss-it main drag.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s one thing to face a hurricane or a flood where you go through it,” Barber, co-chair of the grassroots Poor People’s Campaign, told the Guardian. “It’s damaging, devastating, and then there’s a determination by all of the people who can do something to rebuild and come out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But it’s almost as though these people have to face what I call ‘DOTSD’, where instead of post-traumatic stress disorder, it’s daily ongoing traumatic stress disorder. It just keeps continuing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marilynn Grier, Barber’s words described life pretty well. Like Coats, she lives in a trailer home just off the lake that she left when the flood came on.\n",
      "\n",
      "She described a childhood of relentless instability: an alcoholic mother, daily uncertainty about where her next meal would come from or where she might sleep, moves back and forth between Tchula and Milwaukee.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her teens, she was sexually assaulted. By 14, she had her first child. By 16, she had dropped out of school, to take care of her children and those of other family members. She has never been employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s hard,” she said, “when you ain’t got an education to get a job.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now 35, she is still working towards a GED, the equivalent of a high-school education. But she said the $35 monthly fee was an impediment to completing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the floods, she said, Tchula was a place where she worried about her children’s safety and schooling. She recalled nights spent on the floor, seeking a modicum of protection from shootings throughout the neighborhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They be poppin’ out here like fireworks,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grier wants to see Tchula change, though she isn’t sure how. She has enough hope that, mid-conversation, she takes out her phone and blasts out a Facebook post, asking neighbors if they are willing to get together and clean up trash.\n",
      "\n",
      "She has a fair dose of hopelessness too.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I encourage all my children to get the hell out of Mississippi, period,” she said. “I tell them, ‘If y’all want to be somebody and have something, you got to get away.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "The last time Tchula was inundated, help came. It was the early 1980s and the town was still somewhat integrated. As Tchula became more black, though, fewer resources seemed to be available.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The white people are not here anymore,” said Marie Nelson, a lifelong resident, “because back when black people started being able to afford homes, if you moved next door to a white person, they sold their home just not to be next door to the black people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the town sits in a state of slow decay: dotted with ramshackle trailers, stray dogs roaming, paint stripping off boarded-up homes in the pervasive humidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nelson worked most of her career at a fish plant in Belzoni, the next town over. She started in the late 1980s, making the federal minimum wage of $3.35 an hour. She sees herself as one of the lucky ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is no jobs to go to and get,” she said. “They got to bring work for people to go get work and right now there is no work to do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Holmes county the unemployment rate is 9.4%, nearly three times the national average.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When we talk about record low unemployment in this country right now, that’s not being reflected here in Tchula,” said Barber.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber’s Poor People’s Campaign is a political and social movement built on the idea that political discourse in the US almost always centers around tension between the middle class and the rich but rarely mentions the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Barber calls this lack of attention a form of violence, a framing he credits to the late Coretta Scott King.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The ‘attention violence’ that we have given to the poor is, in my estimation, the greatest failure of the country and our political system,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the most recent flooding, 20 Mississippi counties were designated disaster zones. Holmes wasn’t one of them. According to official state numbers, only two homes in the county were damaged, an undercount made obvious by even a cursory glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials from the Mississippi emergency management administration (Mema) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hearing that number for the first time, the 51-year-old lifelong Tchula resident Gerry Watts could not help but walk off laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We right here!” he said. “Tell them to come see my house! Tell me it wasn’t damaged.”\n",

      "He was one of hundreds who showed up for a rally and town hall on Thursday night, an event headlined by Barber and activists from Holmes and throughout the state.\n",

According to the police, around 11.30am, a police control room call was received reporting that three men who were injured after the roof of a welding workshop in lane 31B of Swatantra Nagar, collapsed on them.Police said that when a team arrived at the spot, they found the locals had pulled the four injured out of the debris, after which they were shifted to hospital. “The Delhi Fire Services and Delhi Disaster Management Authority were also alerted. However, by the time firefighters arrived, the injured had already been moved to hospital,” the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (outer north), Gaurav Sharma, said “The four were identified as Irshad (20), Mohammad Mehraj (28), Juber (22) and Sallauddin, all residents of B4 in Narela. They were all admitted to Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Narela, where Sallauddin was pronounced dead during treatment,” Sharma said.He said an initial probe revealed that the roof of the workshop, which was made of iron bars and silt sheets, had collapsed during construction work at a drain by a contractor of the irrigation and flood control department.“However, it was learnt that no work on the drain was in progress on Saturday. A case of causing death due to negligence has been registered and we are trying to find out whose negligence led to the collapse,” Sharma said.Sallauddin’s body was sent for a post-mortem examination and his family members were informed.\n",

      "NASHIK: In the last fortnight 10 peacocks have died in the forest area near the villages of Dahivad and Dighavat in Chandwad taluka of Nashik district. Forest officials said seven died of the heatwave and three were killed by stray dogs. Four peacocks recovered after treatment by a veterinary doctor.The forest department has conducted panchanama of 10 dead peacocks and said the intense heat in the last week of April led to the death of seven peacocks. There is also a sudden spurt in stray dogs in the villages, and three peacocks died after dogs attacked them, said officials. The forest department has written to the panchayat of Dahivad village requesting villagers to help the department keep stray dogs at bay.\"We filed panchanama for the death of 10 peacocks in both villages. The area is a non-forest area, but we estimate peacock population to be about 200,\" forest official VG Tatpurkar said. He added that there is now some respite from the severity of the heatwave, but stray dogs are continuing to prey on birds. \"We have written to the panchayat and provided 55 earthen pots so water and food can be provided to peacocks,\" he said.\"There are 25 stray dogs in the area that have taken to attacking the birds,\" veterinary doctor Datta Motegaonkar said. The animal husbandry department set up a Rapid Response Team to ensure the peacocks are safe, the doctor said.\n",
